## Features

- Bundle your app using only a `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`
- Opinionated Webpack defaults for both development and production modes
- Prerenders all your app routes _(via [prerender-loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/prerender-loader/))_
- Everything is configurable (and uses technologies you already know)

## Installation

Install suprya using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i -D suprya
```

The minimum supported Node version is `v6.9.0`

## Usage

Suprya takes your Webpack config as an input and adds its own opinionated config values for the ultimate developer experience. To start, open your `webpack.config.js` and wrap your exported config with the `suprya()` function:

```js
const suprya = require('suprya');

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

module.exports = suprya({
  mode: isProduction ? 'production' : 'development',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader'
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

Suprya will take care of adding the entry (`./src/index.js`) and output (defaults to the `dist` directory) options, adding vendor chunk splitting and applying all the plugins for you. But, don't worry, you can still change all these options if you need more flexibility.

Next, we will add the `src/template.html` file which will be the base of all the prerendered outputs (but will also be used in development mode):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      {{prerender:./src/prerender.js}}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, we've used a [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) expression that tells Suprya that the prerendered content (generated by the `prerender.js` file, which we will create on the next step) needs to be appended under `#root`.

Thanks to [prerender-loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/prerender-loader) you can either export a String which will be used as the static HTML or automatically render it on the `#root` element. Depending on what library you're using its contents may vary. Here are some examples:

### React app

Suprya supports any kind of router such as [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) or [Reach router](https://reach.tech/router).

`src/prerender.js`
```js
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

import App from './components/App';

export default () => renderToString(<App />);
```

### Preact app

TODO

### Submit your own!

You can add your own library by submitting a PR! :grinning:

Suprya will call your `prerender.js` default exported function on production for each one of your routes (we take care of setting the right `window.location` value for you).

Also note that you can export an async function or a Promise in case you might want to wait for the DOM rendering to settle down before allowing Suprya to serialize the document to static HTML:

```js
// Taken from the prerender-loader docs
import { render, options } from 'dom-library';
import App from './App';

// We're done when there are no renders for 50ms:
const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 50;

export default () => new Promise(resolve => {
  let timer;

  // Each time your library re-renders, reset our idle timer:
  options.debounceRendering = commit => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(resolve, IDLE_TIMEOUT);
    commit();
  }

  // Rnder into <body> using normal client-side rendering:
  render(<App />, document.body);
})
```
